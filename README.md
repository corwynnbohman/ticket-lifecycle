After adding users and agents, assigning them into departments and teams and configuring the various settings, you can switch between the Admin and Agent panel. Experiment with creating tickets for different apartments and giving them different SLAs, see what happens when a worker solves or transfers a ticket to a coworker. Timestamps are made in the osTicket system to show a ticket's history and are useful in a real company's work environment.
